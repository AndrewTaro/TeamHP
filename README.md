# Team HP
This mod shows the total HP of both teams.

AutoSpy, who no longer plays World of Warships, developed the original concept of this mod.  
My project is a complete rewrite from scratch, with bug fixes and more options.

# Features
There are some noteworthy additions from the original project:
### Animation on HP Transition
- Animations will play to demonstrate HP changes better.
### Regen Monitor
- If you install [Regen Monitor](../../../RegenMonitor), this mod also displays all the regenerable HP of the team.
### HP Modes
There are 2 modes:
- **Relative**: The length of the HP bar is **fixed**. It will use the specified number of blocks to indicate HP. The amount of HP per block varies by team.
- **Absolute**: The length of the HP bar is **variable**. The amount of HP per block is consistent for both teams. Useful for tournament casters.

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive and get `gui`, `PnFMods` folders, and `PnFModsLoader.py`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/PnFModsLoader.py`, etc.
4. Done!

# Requirements
You must install the following in order to use the mod.
- [TTaro Mod Config](../../../TTaroModConfig)
- [DraggableUnbound2](../../../DraggableUnbound2)
